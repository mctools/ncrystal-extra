# ncrystal-extra

Repository with extra resources related to NCrystal
(https://github.com/mctools/ncrystal). This includes utilities and data files
which are for various reasons not suitable for inclusion in the main NCrystal
repository. Examples of what is eventually planned to include here are:

* Data files which are validated, but very large and of limited interest to most users.
* Experimental data files which are incomplete or not validated.
* Various utilities and scripts which are a bit rough around the edges.
