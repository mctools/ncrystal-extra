# Extra validated data files for NCrystal

Files in this subdirectory are believed to be of similar good quality as those
in the main NCrystal repository, and are kept here instead due to issues like
file sizes.

NOTICE: The light and heavy water files in this directory will be removed in the
future, as they are shipped along with the ncrystal-plugin-WaterData package
(you can also find them in this repository at
`pypkgs/ncrystal-plugin-WaterData/src/ncrystal_plugin_WaterData/data/`)
